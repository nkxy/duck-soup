            <h2 class="m-16">Why design?</h2>
            <p class="m-32">I've taken a bit of a scenic route on my way to design - starting first with software development, and then moving onto product management. In both cases, there was something missing, which I eventually found in design.
                <br><br> Empathy. I know it's just slightly overused, but I'm deeply passionate about it. Putting yourself in someone else's shoes is not easy, but allows you to gain so much perspective. As a designer, it helps not only with understanding
                your user, but also with your teammates.
                <br><br> Great collaboration can go miles above what any individual can do. It's a great feeling when you're able to bounce ideas off one another when trying to solve a challenging design problem, or other ideas sparking something in your
                head.
                <br><br>Growing up, I would look around and imitate what my parents or friends were doing. Monkey see, monkey do. But who was I in all of this? What was I bringing to the table? Design presents a great opportunity for me to be inspired
                by others, but to also push myself to create something new and uniquely me.</p>

                    <p class="m-16 no-top-margin">UW Blueprint builds software products for social good by working closely with our non-profit partners. I worked on a project for Plastics For Change, where we helped reduce plastic pollution in India through a web app for waste pickers.
                        I also had the privilege to lead the organization for two terms as president, where I was able to help our organization grow in our capabilities. </p>

                    <p class="m-16 no-top-margin">I had a big podcast phase when I started university. During this, I started two podcasts, one of them for Engineers Without Borders. We examined modern issues through a systemic thinking lens. In other words, we talked a lot about
                        weed, Reddit, and the Tims on campus, and how they illustrate systems principles.</p>

            <h2 class="m-16">What I do for fun</h2>
            <p class="m-32">I learned piano for eight years as a kid and resented for all eight years. Now it's a fun thing that keeps me going everyday. Right now in the world it feels outcomes are a bit out of my control; goals I was working for are no longer feasible,
                plans canceled. But what I can control is what I do every day and the intrinsic pleasure I gain from that. I'm only playing because I enjoy it, and I like that a lot.
                <br><br> Thanks to yoga, recently I was able to touch my toes for the first time in my life. I now want to do the splits. No reason, other than it looks really cool - we'll see how far I can get üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

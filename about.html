            <h2 class="m-16">Why design?</h2>
            <p class="m-32">My passion of tech comes from the potential it has to positively impact people's lives. As I gained experience as a developer and a product manager, I realized what I loved most was solving problems that are close to the user, which led me
                to UX design.
                <br><br> I love how supportive the design community is, and how feedback and communication are essential. Working as a UX designer, I enjoy the balance between understanding & applying UX principles with more creative designs. I find myself
                constantly pushing to improve how I work through the design process, and the results in the final product I create.</p>
            <h2 class="m-16">Other stuff I do</h2>
            <p class="m-32">I initially picked up learning German for fun, but I got pretty invested quickly. Words have always had a special place in my heart, and learning an new language is like being introduced to a whole new family. Please send any good German TV
                shows/movie recommendations üôè
                <br><br> I used to be terrible at dancing (I still am) but I wouldn't even try, even with no one watching. But life is too short to be living it afraid of your own body, so I've been learning contemporary choreography online. The self-expression
                and emotion involved is great üòÄ
                <br><br> I'm trying to get more flexible through yoga to be able to do the splits someday. Before I started yoga I couldn't even touch my toes, so we'll see how far I can get.
            </p>
